# Project requirements
Create a front-end application that could be added to personal portfolio and presented to potential employers. 
Develop the application concept and user story considering the type of users, what they want and why.
Create a 10-minute presentation to provide a brief overview of the application, work that has been done and ideas for future development.

# destination-guide

**Destination Guide, is an all-in-one application that offers a range of services such as currency conversion, country information and weather information for tourists.** 

With just one search, we bring together these services to provide convenience and efficiency for the user. Rather than, having to switch back and forth across multiple separate applications, Destination Guide gives you the same information, easier and faster. 

Project contributors: Priscilla, Inna, Susan and Cyprian.

**Motivation for Development:**

To create ease and convenience for users -  a “one-stop-shop” giving them all the neccessary information about the search location, as opposed to visiting several separate applications for currency conversion, weather information, local information etc. 

## Wireframe:
We approached this task by first creating a wireframe on Adobe InDesign to map out what elements are required:

## Ideas for Future Development:

* Implement Google Maps feature on search page, where user is taken to search city (not country).
* Interactive maps where user can search for attractions nearby and drop pins on places they’d like to visit. 
* Include city specific information - find a city API. 
* Include language translation API.
